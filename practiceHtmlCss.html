        Hey guys, my name is Reid. Me llamo Reid. Yes, that's Spanish for my
        name is Reid. By now you might think I'm quite the narcissist since I've
        managed to tell you my name 3 different times in a matter of seconds.
        Well, I'm not. I'm studying to become a programmer, web developer. My
        hope is to build my skills to share my story, to help others share their
        stories, and to simply create cool stuff. I think that last point is
        most exciting because the goal is to make a full time income doing this.
        And if I can do that while enjoying just being creative and having fun
        then that's a win-win in my book.
      </p>

        Also, I put a random picture of some majestic looking deer here because
        I'm studying my hunters ed to get my license. I'd like to go on my first
        hunting trip by summer 2023 assuming the world is still habitable at
        that point. Listen, things aren't looking so great right now. It's
        really by the grace of God that I can be setting goals like this in the
        first place. Some people I'm sure have relegated themselves to biting
        their fingernails all day while watching the news. Maybe not actually.
        That would be super unproductive and those kinda people don't survive
        very long. Anyway, enjoy my website!

        Yup thats Texas, so it's pretty ugly but I suppose everyone has to start
        there. I don't care if you're the Don, he didn't come out of the womb
        beautiful. Sure you can come from wealth but life is ugly and war is the
        default. Anyway I'm getting ahead of myself. It's not that bad. God led
        me here and I'm not going to complain, I'm going to work and better
        myself with what I've been given. I'm a long ways away from my humble
        beginnings growing up in the suburbs of Washington DC in Fairfax, VA. I
        say humble but we had all we needed. We had some pretty rich neighbors
        so it made us look less well off. It's crazy how life moves so quickly.
